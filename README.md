This project was meant to advance my understanding on how algorithms are designed and how they work. This program has bubble sort and a bogosort algorithm implemented. To run this code compile and run code with a number 1 or larger. The code will create an array and fill the array in with values from 1 - (selected value). It will then randomize this array and create a duplicate array with memcpy. Then the algoirthms will sort each of one of their arrays and print out the sorted array with how long it took. 
One problem I faced when writing the bogosort algorithm is finding an algorithm is that truly random is c is not easy. Because of this the bogosort algorithm is not perfect, it is much faster at finding the sorted array then it should be. 

Run the code by first compiling in gcc or any other compiler that is able to compile c. Once you have the compile excute with ./bogoVSBubble n   n can be any number 1 or greater.
